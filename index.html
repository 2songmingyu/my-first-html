    <h2>WEB</h2>
    <p>aThe World Wide Web (abbreviated WWW or the Web) is an information space where documents and other <br>
    web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext links, and can be <br>
    accessed via the Internet.[1] English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. <br>
    He wrote the first web browser computer program in 1990 while employed at CERN in Switzerland.[2][3] <br>
    Web browser was released outside of CERN in 1991, first to other research institutions starting in January <br>
    1991 and to the general public on the Internet in August 1991.
